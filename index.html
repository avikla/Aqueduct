<p  style="text-align: center;">This webpage summarizes numerous research findings and documents regarding the precise paths, tunnels and locations</p>
<p  style="text-align: center;">  Each tunnel and location is mapped with exact geographical coordinates (ESPG:4326)</p>
<p  style="text-align: center;">  Any feedback, corrections or suggestions are welcomed</p>

<h2>Brief explanation</h2>
<p>This Roman-era water system, constructed around the 1st century, relied solely on gravity. At its heart are three large reservoirs known as Solomon&rsquo;s Pools, located southwest of Bethlehem. The total length is 82.5 kilometers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These pools were fed from the south by two main channels, each sourcing water from several wells (marked in red):</p>
<ul>
<li>The Arrub line (<span style="color: #009688;"><strong>green 41,308m</strong></span>) - It begins at the Arrub pool and includes three tunnels.</li>
<li>The Biyar line (<span style="color: #ab47bc;"><strong>purple 5,012m</strong></span>) - It starts at Ein-Biyar with a long tunnel before passing through the Dahr-Baku tunnel.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Solomon&rsquo;s Pools, two aqueducts carried water to Jerusalem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lower aqueduct (<span style="color: #d32f2f;"><strong>red 21,447m</strong></span>). A longer route passes through two tunnels before reaching the Temple Mount. It remained in use until roughly 100 years ago.</li>
<li>The upper aqueduct (<span style="color: #42a5f5;"><strong>blue 14,735m</strong></span>). Positioned about 30 meters higher than the lower aqueduct.&nbsp;<br />West of Bethlehem, it employed an inverted-siphon made of stone.&nbsp;<br />Its exact path into northern Jerusalem remains uncertain, so two possible routes are shown in <span style="color: #009688;"><strong>green</strong></span> and <span style="color: #ff9800;"><strong>orange</strong></span> with bridge or inverted-siphon options.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tunnels are indicated in yellow, along with their known construction shafts (red circles).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Archaeological discoveries are noted with green diamonds and are clickable. Many other points on the map are clickable, providing additional information and links to relevant articles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonus: The system of Gihon-Siloah (Silowan) that was built in the 6th century BC is added to the map south of the Temple Mountain.</p>
